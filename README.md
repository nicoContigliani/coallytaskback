## Data Transfer Object (DTO)

This application utilizes a **Data Transfer Object (DTO)** to format the response data for tasks. The DTO is defined in the `tasksDto.js` file.

---

## Dependencies

This application depends on the following npm packages:

- **Express**: Web framework for handling routes and requests.

---

## Additional Notes

- **Error Handling**: Error handling is implemented for all API endpoints to provide informative error messages in case of issues.
- **Asynchronous Syntax**: The code utilizes `async/await` syntax for cleaner and more readable handling of asynchronous operations.
